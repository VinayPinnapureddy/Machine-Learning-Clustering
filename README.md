# Machine-Learning-Clustering

This repository maintains variety of Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms.

With this project we able to know which Clustering algorithm suits whcih type of problems.

# Description

In this project we explore Classification techniques.

1) K-Means Clustering ( Elbow method is used to find Optimum number of Clusters )

2) Hierarchical Clustering ( Dendrogram method is used to find Optimum number of Clusters )
